When this happens, you will see an error message on your printer screen or computer screen saying that "A printer's ink pad is at the end of its service life" or "Parts inside your printer are near the end of their service life". You will also see a red light flashing on your printer.

To reset the waste ink counter, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the "Particular adjustment mode" button on the main interface of the program.
2. Select "Waste ink pad counter" from the list of options and click OK.
3. You will see a window showing the current status of your waste ink counter. Check both boxes for "Main pad counter" and "Platen pad counter" and click "Check".
4. The program will read and display the current values of your waste ink counter. If they are above 100%, it means that your waste ink pads are full and need to be reset. 0f148eb4a0
