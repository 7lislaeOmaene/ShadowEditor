# Tabla De Tolerancias Iso Pdf Download: A Guide to ISO General Tolerances and Geometrical Tolerances
 
If you are looking for a way to simplify your drawings and specify general tolerances for your plastic moulded parts, you may want to download the Tabla De Tolerancias Iso Pdf. This is a document that contains the ISO 2768 and ISO 20457 standards, which provide general tolerances for linear dimensions, angular dimensions, external radii, chamfer heights, straightness, flatness, perpendicularity, symmetry, and circular run-out. These tolerances are applicable to all dimensions without individual tolerance indications.
